# Identity-Management-Project
Just a simple project I made to implement MySQL and PHP

Software prerequisites required:
1. Apache2/HTTPD web server or a similar technology
2. MySQL or MariaDB 5.0 or above
3. PHP 7.0

To install the software onto your computer, run install.sh with sudo or root privileges.
Once that is done, restart your server's service, go to localhost on your web-browser to test if the program is running.
